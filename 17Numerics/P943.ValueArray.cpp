// valarray correspond to a mathematical concept: a linear sequence of values.

// it's borned for mathmatical operations like vectors and matrices.

// so better not to use it.

// If you are looking for vectors and matrices operations support,
//      try to write it in you own or look for support of 3rd party libraries like Eigen (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
